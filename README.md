UiShare
=======


This is a simple application to share Keyboard and mouse across different computers with cross platform compatability.


With this, any of the computers mouse and keyboard can be shared to others i.e a single mouse and keyboard can be used to share across multiple system. The transition occurs when the mouse reaches a screen edge.

Current Status
==============

I have used PyMouse and Py Keyboard for tracking the users movements.
 - Have tested Mouse sharing and keyboard sharing seperately
 - However all the actions have effect on the host system also hence this has to be avoided
 - Currently supports only for 2 PC as i couldnt figure out how to vitually extend my screen programatically

ToDo
====
 - To provide both mouse and keyboard sharing (currently have has 2 seperate files)
 
 - To hook the mouse and keyboard so that 
 
 - To add GUI for rollout as application 
 
Thankyou everyone... Feel free to pointout corrections enhancements etc.. :D
